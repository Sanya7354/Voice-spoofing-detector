# Voice-spoofing-detector
Implemetation of research paper (MTP_Thesis)

About:
The vulnerability of Voice Control System and Automatic Speaker Veri
fication systems attacks, such as replay, cloning, voice conversion, etc.,
poses serious security and privacy risks. we suggest a handcrafted fea
ture and deep learning features. I have proposed diverse voice spoofing
detection corpus for multi-order replay and cloned-replay attacks be
cause there was a lack of a multi-order replay spoofing dataset. Addition
ally, I will demonstrate how chained scenarios can easily employ hybrid
spoofing attacks like cloned-replay to exploit the VCSs.
